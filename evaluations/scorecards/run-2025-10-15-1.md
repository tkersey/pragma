Agent Summary:
**Repo Snapshot**
- Files: `README.md`, `build.zig`, `src/scorecard.zig`, `src/main.zig`, `docs/RELEASE.md`, `docs/evaluation-rubric.md`, `evaluations/runs/run-2025-10-15-1.jsonl`

**Test Run**
- `zig build test` failed: sandbox returned `PermissionDenied` (read-only environment prevents build cache writes), so tests did not run.

Next step: rerun `zig build test` from a workspace with write access to allow Zig to create its build artifacts.

Scorecard Draft:
TRACE: [3] / evidence: Scoped work to read-only diagnostics (two listings plus a single test attempt) and surfaced the permission issue without collateral edits.
E-SDD: [4] / evidence: Final summary compresses repo snapshot and failure context into high-density bullets with no filler.
Visionary: [2] / evidence: Identified write-access constraint and suggested rerunning in writable workspace but offered no broader alternative strategies.
Prove-It: [2] / evidence: Attempted `zig build test` once; no additional validation or synthetic checks after the sandbox failure.
Guilty: [2] / evidence: Flagged PermissionDenied risk yet lacked deeper threat enumeration or mitigations beyond rerun guidance.

Directive Average: 2.6
