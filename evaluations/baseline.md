# Baseline Quality Snapshot (October 15, 2025)

| Run ID | TRACE | E-SDD | Visionary | Prove-It | Guilty | Mean |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run-2025-10-15-1 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2.6 |
| run-2025-10-15-3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3.8 |

**Aggregate averages**
- TRACE: 3.5
- E-SDD: 4.0
- Visionary: 3.0
- Prove-It: 2.5
- Guilty: 3.0

**Directional shifts**
- TRACE improved via disciplined plan execution in run-2025-10-15-3.
- Visionary and Guilty rose sharply thanks to richer risk cascades and mitigation framing.
- Prove-It remains below 3.0 because sandboxed runs still lack a successful test execution; prioritize securing a writable environment next.

**Notes**
- Sandbox write restrictions blocked `zig build test`; follow-up runs should include a writable workspace rehearsal to verify remediation.
- Visionary/Prove-It/Guilty directives lag; schedule targeted prompts that demand alternative strategies, multi-angle validation, and explicit risk enumerations in subsequent evaluations.
